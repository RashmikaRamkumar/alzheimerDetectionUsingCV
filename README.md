Overview
The Alzheimer Disease Detection application takes an MRI or CT scan image as input and uses a trained CNN model to classify it into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease. This provides clinicians and researchers with a valuable, quick, and accurate tool for understanding a patient's condition.

The application is built with:

Frontend: React (Upload Form for image selection)
Backend: Flask API (for handling image uploads and predictions)
Model: CNN model trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras
About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, cognitive abilities, and behavior. Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and eventually, loss of bodily functions.

There are four commonly classified stages of Alzheimer’s:

Normal: No signs of Alzheimer's in brain scans.
Very Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): Minor memory issues that do not impact daily functioning.
Mild Cognitive Impairment: Noticeable memory, thinking, and language issues.
Moderate Cognitive Impairment: Significant memory loss, requiring assistance with daily tasks.
Early detection and intervention can help slow down the disease's progression and improve quality of life for those affected.

Approach: Computer Vision and CNN
Computer Vision in Medical Imaging
Computer Vision (CV) techniques allow us to analyze medical images for patterns and anomalies. In this application, we use CV to interpret brain scan images, detecting areas associated with Alzheimer’s.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks because they learn spatial hierarchies in images through layers of convolutions, pooling, and activation functions. Our CNN model has been trained to detect specific features related to Alzheimer’s Disease stages:

Convolutional Layers extract essential features from brain scan images.
Pooling Layers reduce the spatial dimensions, retaining the most critical information.
Fully Connected Layers interpret these extracted features to predict the Alzheimer’s stage.
The model has been trained and validated on a labeled dataset of brain images to achieve high accuracy in classifying the stages of Alzheimer’s.

Model Training Process
The model training involved the following steps:

Data Collection: Collect MRI or CT scans of brain images labeled by Alzheimer’s stage.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, apply image augmentation, and normalize pixel values.
Model Architecture Design: Configure layers, including convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Training: Train the model on labeled data, optimizing weights to minimize error.
Validation: Test the model with unseen data to evaluate accuracy.
Application Structure and Functionality
The application contains:

UploadForm.jsx: A React component allowing users to select and upload an image.
Flask Backend: Receives the image file, runs it through the model, and returns the predicted stage of Alzheimer’s.
Key Files and Directories
src/components/UploadForm.jsx: Frontend component for image selection and upload.
src/style.css: Styling for the application.
app.py: Flask API backend that handles image prediction requests.
model.h5: Trained CNN model for Alzheimer’s stage classification.
